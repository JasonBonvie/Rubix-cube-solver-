Install cmake through homebrew

cd into RubixCube6
first remove the CmakeCache.txt file

For the first run execute this:

$ cmake .
$ make
$ ./Rubix

After the first successful compilation you will only need to run:
$ make
$ ./Rubix

These commands are for Unix systems only

If you're on windows, good luck with that.
